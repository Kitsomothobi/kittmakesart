        <p>Art: The Quintessential Form of Self-Expression
        Art has a storied history, spanning thousands of years, but today we explore the journey of fellow artists and their own experiences with this medium.
        Today, we embark on Verônica’s artistic journey and investigate what it has meant for her so far.
        The purpose of this interview is to collect insights and shed light on the inner workings of the artist’s mind. It aims to provide fellow artists and readers a glimpse into the human side of creating art, while allowing ourselves the space to be vulnerable in the process.


        Introduction:
        Verônica (she/her) is a 20-year-old Brazilian artist undertaking the Herculean task of drawing every day. Today, we will explore the nuances of her 274-day journey and what it has entailed for her.
        Her story:
        Verônica started much like many other artists—with a deep passion for creative expression in her childhood. Over time, she cultivated her skills, but her journey has been far from easy.
        She describes it as being tinged with tragedy, recounting:
        “Everyone thought I had no future in it.”
        Rather than succumbing to doubt, Verônica used these criticisms as fuel to prove her detractors wrong.

        She recalls a turning point in her artistic development:
        “Back in 2020, I got my tablet, and it helped me a lot with improving my drawings. For the first time, people were seeing potential in my art.”
        This highlights the importance of having an engaging and supportive environment. For many artists, the early stages of their journey are fraught with challenges, making it easy to fall into despair.
        Verônica elaborates further:
        “And my best friend helped me a lot. She lent me her account to access art classes and is always inspiring me to become better.”

        Her words underscore a universal truth: as artists, we share an innate drive to reach “the next level” , to expand our abilities. The journey feels like a battle fought on two fronts: the physical(the technical skills honed through practice) and the immaterial(the love, support, and validation we receive from others.)


        The Task:
        For context, Verônica’s current challenge involves creating daily fan art for the upcoming Wonder Woman game. Until the game’s official release, she continues her daily artistic endeavour, cheered on by her supporters.
        But this journey is not without its difficulties. The immense physical and emotional toll of such a rigorous approach to art is undeniable. When asked how she navigates the stress in a healthy way, she shared:

        “It’s been a bit hard to have ideas every day, and some days I get so busy that I can barely make time for drawing. There were days I wished I could give up. There were days I thought I could have done better. But I always told myself, ‘Not yet.’ I will not give up yet.
        And then, there were days I was so proud of my art, I felt like I was on cloud nine, filled with happiness and pride for what I had created.”

        When asked how she finds the strength to keep going, day after day, she explained:
        “I always think about the people who like my art. I remind myself that I’m getting closer and closer to my dream coming true. I want to keep going.
        I also remember why I started this challenge in the first place: to make something of my life. I always felt underwhelmed and lost, but when I started this, it gave me something to look forward to each day. It gave me a reason to wake up and create tomorrow. It helped me deal with depression.”

        It is also important to note that Verônica has struggled with health complications throughout her journey, complications that may or may not have been related to her daily art routines. However, she has crucially managed to take the necessary rest and recovery to sustain her goals in a healthy and productive manner.
        I highly encourage anyone considering a similar challenge to do so in a safe and responsible way. Art should be a therapeutic and enjoyable experience, so be sure to take the time to address any underlying issues you may have. Talk to friends and family, reach out to our community, and approach your challenges at a pace that is both healthy and sustainable.
        ​
        The process:
        Veronica details her favourite part of her artistic process as such:
        "If I am drawing on my phone, then it is the shading! If it is on my Pc/tablet, then it is the Lineart and coloring and if it’s on the paper, I really love sketching"

        ​Art Program: MediBang Paint
        
        She further comments on how the act of finishing a piece she feels proud of, makes her feel:
        “it’s like I am in heaven I feel so proud and happy I feel like I am getting better and I feel like I can do anything I want if I put enough effort into it It helps me to keep moving forward”

        Reflection:
        Verônica’s journey has made me reconsider the nature of art and how different people handle adversity in their own unique ways. What might seem unproductive or even detrimental to one artist’s well-being can serve as a source of meaning and accomplishment for another.
        Perhaps there are no “correct” ways to improve or create art. Instead, the essence lies in the journey we take and, most importantly, in the people we choose to have by our side along the way.
        Verônica has been a huge inspiration to me, both as an artist and as a friend. I love watching her evolve daily, experimenting with new approaches and slowly mastering the mechanics of art. I admire the community she has built on the r/WonderWoman subreddit and the pivotal role she plays in inspiring others within that niche.
        All this to say, I am beyond grateful to have had the opportunity to highlight Verônica’s story. It is an honour to share her journey with my community—and hopefully, with the rest of the world.
        Valeu Verô🫶🤍
